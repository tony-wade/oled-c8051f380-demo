This project separates the control logic from the hardware layer, enabling flexible modification or migration to other microcontrollers.

Features:

    1.  Real-time display of switch event transitions (e.g., double-clicks, press, hold)
    
    2.  Clear separation between control logic and events
    
    3.  Modular design for custom input-event mapping and UI rendering
